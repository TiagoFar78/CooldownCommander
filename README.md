This plugin allows you to set different tpa cooldowns (from essentials plugin) to players with different permissions. It is really easy to use since you only have to give players the permission "essentials.tpa.cooldown.<cooldown>" where <cooldown> is the desired tpa cooldown in seconds.

# Permissions
- essentials.tpa.cooldown.<cooldown> - <cooldown> is the desired tpa cooldown in seconds.
